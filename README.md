# FolderExploderRshiny
A utility to explode folder with Rshiny as GUI

Motivation:
Most of the time, files generated by other software will be in a relatively deep directory. The pdf file you need is inside a folder within a folder on the desktop. Extracting those file without using any programming language is rather time consuming, especially when there are many directories of subdirectory.

I get the inspiration for creating this Rshiny app from my previous internship: I need to parse hundreds of html files, but all the html files are rather deep in the directories; thus I created R scripts to copy all html files from their subdirectories to a single folder for easy manipulation. I called this "folder explosion"

This Rshiny application serve as GUI for performing such tasks, with the option of:

1. Specifying the depth of explosion needed. (0 for simple copy and paste, 1 for copying files and folders from 1 level down from the root directory)

2. Specifying resursive option. When resursive option is chosen, all individual files inside a directory will be exploded to the destination folder.

3. Allowing user to specifying file name of interest, with three options connected with AND condition. The three options are "Start with", "contains", "end with".

For example, start with "Accounting", contains "July", "csv" will explode files with name starting with the word "Accounting", AND contains the word "July", with csv as file extension.


Instruction to use the app:
1. Install R and Rstudio
2. Start the application
 - Option 1: Download the repository and run the app using Rstudio
 - Option 2: install shiny package in R and use the function runGithub:

if (!require('shiny')) install.packages("shiny")
shiny::runGitHub(repo = "FolderExploderRshiny", username = "kwei321")

3. Enter the source folder and destination folder. The destination folder must be created first. Select the depth of explosion. If needed, use the advanced option to extract filename with certain pattern
4. Hit the Explode Folder button.
